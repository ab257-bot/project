            <h1 class="display-4">How did this film impact those who watched it?</h1>
            <p class="lead">The film was produced during the Great Depression, a time of economic hardship in the United States. It resonated with audiences who were experiencing similar struggles, offering both escapism and a reflection of their own lives.</p>
            <hr class="my-4">
            <p>By 1937, women’s roles in Hollywood had significantly declined compared to the silent film era. The Hollywood studio system along with the Motion Picture Production Code known as the “Hay’s code” actively sidelined women from positions of power and creative influence. Hay’s code limited the depiction women as independent, sexually liberated or morally ambiguous characters. Instead, women were now depicted as wives, mothers, or romantic interests whose lives revolved around men and marriage which reinforced traditional values.
However, “A Star is Born” portrayed a female protagonist as the huge star whereas her male protagonist saw his decline due to his alcoholism. This might have struck a nerve to male audiences, but it is this writer's opinion that the film reflected the economic anxieties that were occurring at the time in the United States. During the Great Depression, many families witness the male head of household and sole breadwinner lose employment and, in some instances, women were forced to fill that role. Men felt inadequate and anxious about their traditional male role in the nuclear family. Norman’s alcoholism and inability to cope with his fading career while his wife gained stardom was an image that the audience at that time would have understood all too well in that era.
Hollywood during the Great Depression was seen as an escape and a source of hope for audiences. This film is a fitting example of that, in the film Ether’s grandmother encourages Esther’s dreams of stardom by comparing it to the original American pioneer spirit by telling her “There’ll always be a wilderness to conquer” this writer can only imagine that this sentiment impacted audiences in a very profound way given the hard times.</p>
