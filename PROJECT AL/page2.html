            <p> “A Star is Born” premiered to an overwhelmingly positive public and critical reception and commercial success. It was the first film to use technicolor which critics praised as a subtle application to a modern story. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture and won an honorary award for its color cinematography. The film earned 2.37 million dollars worldwide.
The film tells the story of a young aspiring actress Esther Blodgett portrayed by Janet Gaynor with the Great Depression as the background. Being from a modest upbringing specifically from a family of farmers, Esther holds little hopes of being anything else other than a farm girl, it is her grandmother who inspires her to search for her dreams in Hollywood and gives her the money she planned to leave behind for her funeral. Esther leaves for Hollywood with the hopes of finding stardom. However, reality hits her hard when she is told by an agency that there is not enough work for all the people applying to be extras; she is shown a switchboard room and told that each of those calls is someone asking for work. She finds work thanks to an out-of-work assistant director catering for a party in which many of the Hollywood elite will be present. Esther meets Norman Maine portrayed by Frederic March; she is a fan of Norman having seen many of his movies but on a separate occasion witnessed Norman in an inebriated state causing a scene which causes her to have a negative opinion of him. Norman is surprised by Esthers charm and goes out of his way to meet and talk to her. Later Norman struck by Esthers mannerisms convinces a studio producer to give Esther a screen test, here Esther impresses the produces who instantly signs her and gives her a makeover and name change to Vicky Lester. Esther, now known as Vicky, rises rapidly to stardom and begins to eclipse Norman in popularity. Norman and Vicky fall in love and marry. However, Norman falls further into his alcohol addiction and causes public incidents that further hurt his career. To help her husband Vicky confides to her producer that she plans to leave work and focus on the care of Norman to get him back to his feet, unbeknownst to Vicky, Norman hears her plans and unwilling to ruin her career as he has his decides to walk into the ocean and drowns himself. Vicky is devastated by this and decides to quit Hollywood; however, she is visited by her grandmother who once again tells her that despite the odds and tragedy handed to her, she must fight on. The film concludes with Vicky's
proclamation “Hello everybody this is Mrs. Norman Maine” to reporters and radio listeners at her films premiere, honoring her husband’s as well as her own legacy.
